// This file has been replaced with improved components in ContentView.swift
// to fix compiler timeout issues by breaking down complex expressions.
//
// The SearchFiltersView and its components are now defined in ContentView.swift:
// - CategoryFilter struct
// - CategoryFilterButton component  
// - CountryFilterChip component
// - SortOptionRow component
// - SearchFiltersView with computed properties
//
// This modular approach helps the compiler process each piece separately
// and eliminates complex nested expressions that were causing timeouts.
